Your task is to analyze the object shown in the provided image and respond to the following strictly in valid JSON format (no explanations or additional comments):

{
    "object": "name of the object",
    "product_type": "type of product (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, etc.)",
  "recyclable": "Yes" or "No",
  "Coins_earned": approximate value (number only, no â‚¹ symbol),
  
}

Guidelines:
- "recyclable" should be "Yes" only if the object can be commonly recycled in India.
- "estimated_value" should reflect approximate income from recycling that item (based on scrap/reuse value).
- "profit_rating_out_of_10" should be higher for higher recycling profit potential.

Do not include anything other than the JSON output.
